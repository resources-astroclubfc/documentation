Until now, to set Node.js version on Clever Cloud, you had to use the `engines.node` field in `package.json` for Node.js applications, or the `CC_NODE_VERSION` environment variable for all other runtimes. Now, you can use `CC_NODE_VERSION` for Node.js applications too. It won't change anything for existing applications, but we recommend you to switch for such behavior.
