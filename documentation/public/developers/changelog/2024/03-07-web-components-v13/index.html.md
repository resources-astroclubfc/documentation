Clever Cloud's [Web Components](https://www.clever-cloud.com/developers/clever-components) v13 are available, with bug fixes, refactoring, and new features. We introduced new possibilities to highlight form fields (larger labels, with color), paving the way for our new add-on/application creation process.
