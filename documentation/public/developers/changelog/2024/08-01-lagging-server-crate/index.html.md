When we release new versions of our reverse proxy [S≈çzu](https://www.sozu.io), we now systematically run performances tests. To conduct some of them directly from our CI, we developed a small tool: Lagging Server. It's open source, and now [available as a Rust crate](https://crates.io/crates/lagging_server) anyone can use.
