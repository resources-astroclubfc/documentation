Since [latest big update](../01-30-js-client-8.0.3/) of the [JS Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@clevercloud/client/v/8.2.0), we've fixed multiple issues with Server-Sent Events (SSE). [8.2.0 release](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-client.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#820-2024-02-27) allows error handling from legacy client and brings support repeatable query parameters, which is a feature enabler for some tools.
