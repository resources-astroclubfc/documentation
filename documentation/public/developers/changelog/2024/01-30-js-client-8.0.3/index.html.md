If you want to use our API from a JavaScript application or module, we provide an easy-to-use open source client, available [as a npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@clevercloud/client). It has just been updated to [version 8.0.3](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-client.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#803-2024-01-30) where the options param of the `on` method is optional. There are fixes for the auto retry of logs SSE v2, event WS. But also for new logs SSE v4 ([ApplicationLogStream](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-client.js/pull/93)).
