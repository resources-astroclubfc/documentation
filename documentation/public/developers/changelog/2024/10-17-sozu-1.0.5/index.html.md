[Sōzu](https://www.sozu.io) 1.0.5 is now available and deployed on `cleverapps.io` domains, we're progressively rolling it out on our own domains and dedicated load balancers. Since [the release of Sōzu 1.0.2](../06-07-sozu-1.0.2) we've fixed some bugs, improved CLI, metrics and performances.

We're currently testing the 1.1.0 release candidate of Sōzu, with HTTP/2 support, coming soon on Clever Cloud.
