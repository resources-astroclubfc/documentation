There is now a dedicated page [to list web sessions in the Clever Cloud Console](https://console.clever-cloud.com/users/me/session-tokens). It shows all the sessions currently active across your devices and browsers with creation/expiration date, last activity. You can revoke any sessions, except the current one (disconnect from the Console to revoke it).
