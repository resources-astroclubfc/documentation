[Sōzu](https://www.sozu.io) 1.0.6 is now available and deployed on all our shared and dedicated load balancers. It comes with a fix for a TLS bug we encountered with [Metabase](/developers/doc/addons/metabase) instances in some cases. We've also overhauled the custom pages for 4xx and 5xx errors. They now display a better designed and more detailed message.
