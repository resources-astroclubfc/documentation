With [0.6.0 release](/developers/changelog/2025/02-19-terraform-0.6-redis/) of the Clever Cloud Terraform provider (compatible with OpenTofu), we introduced the support of resource update. Starting with [0.7.0](https://github.com/CleverCloud/terraform-provider-clevercloud/releases/tag/v0.7.0) you can now apply a new plan without destroying and recreating the resource on Docker, Java, Python, Scala and Static applications.
