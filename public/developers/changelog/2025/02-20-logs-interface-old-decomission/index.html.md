[Last year](/developers/changelog/2024/07-17-new-logs-default/) we introduced a new logs interface in [the Console](https://console.clever-cloud.com) and enhanced it since then. After some months [using it by default](/developers/changelog/2024/07-17-new-logs-default/), we start decommissioning our old logs stack. Thus, you can't switch to the previous interface anymore for applications.

Next, we'll use the new stack for add-ons, access logs and continue improving the interface. A big step will be to introduce logs indexing, allowing you to better search through your logs and load the latest.

Feel free to ask for features and improvements in our [GitHub Community space](https://github.com/CleverCloud/Community/discussions/categories/new-logs-interface).
