After [renewing OAuth consumers management](/developers/changelog/2025/05-28-oauth-consumer-new-interface/), we've just updated the [OAuth tokens section](https://console.clever-cloud.com/users/me/oauth-tokens) of users profile. It's where you can see applications linked to your Clever Cloud account: Clever Tools, the Console or those linked to other OAuth consumers. You can still see creation and expiration date, last usage, revoke any or all of themâ€¦ but in a clearer interface.

We also added a link to Clever Cloud's OAuth tokens documentation.
