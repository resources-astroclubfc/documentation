The release `26.1.4` of Keycloak is available on Clever Cloud. [It fixes](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/releases/26.1.4) some bugs, upgrades to Infinispan 15.0.14 and allows administrator to disable automatic refresh of event views `admin/ui`. In this release we also introduce automatic client provisioning.

To update, just set `CC_KEYCLOAK_VERSION` of the add-on's Java application to `26.1.4` and rebuild it.
