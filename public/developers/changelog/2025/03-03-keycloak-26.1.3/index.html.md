The release `26.1.3` of Keycloak is available on Clever Cloud. [It fixes](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/releases/26.1.3) some bugs, and we enhanced [realm import procedures](/developers/doc/addons/keycloak/#importing-realms-data). To update, just set `CC_KEYCLOAK_VERSION` of the add-on's Java application to `26.1.3` and rebuild it.
