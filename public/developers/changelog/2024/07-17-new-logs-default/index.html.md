New logs interface is available in the Console in public beta [for some months](../04-15-new-logs-interface-public-beta/), and we already [enhanced it](../06-21-better-new-logs/). We're now confident enough to use it by default. You can still disable it. If you have any question or feedback, use our [GitHub Community space](https://github.com/CleverCloud/Community/discussions/categories/new-logs-interface).
