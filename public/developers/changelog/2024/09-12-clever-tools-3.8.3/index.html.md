After two minor releases fixing issues with drains, [Clever Tools 3.8.3](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-tools/releases/tag/3.8.3) is available. It fixes Nix support, `update-notifier` and enhances the add-on deletion command. It will now only need the add-on ID or name if it's in an organisation linked to your account.

To upgrade Clever Tools, [use your favorite package manager](/developers/doc/cli/install). For example with `npm`:

```
npm update -g clever-tools
clever version
```
