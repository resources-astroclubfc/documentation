To manage your resources as code on Clever Cloud, from applications to add-ons (object storage, databases, etc.), you can use our Terraform provider. It's compatible with tools such as [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) and can now deploy applications using [our Docker runtime](/developers/doc/applications/docker/).

You can define instances count or flavors, region, dependencies, ports, Dockerfile and application paths, registry credentials and more. Read [the full parameters list](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CleverCloud/clevercloud/latest/docs/resources/docker).
