As part of our images' enhancement process, we've tidied up the [list of supported servlet containers](/developers/doc/applications/java/java-war/#available-containers). Those that are no longer used by our customers are removed from the Java image. If you need a container which is not listed in [the servlet container list](/developers/doc/applications/java/java-war/#available-containers) or a specific version, please contact [our support team](https://console.clever-cloud.com/ticket-center-choice). This release also includes a [Wildfly](https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly) upgrade. Versions 27.0.1 and 33.0.1 are now available.
