Since 2023, applications use a new Logs stack based on Pulsar and Vector, through CLI. Thanks to it, we provide a more reliable service, with new filtering features. It's now available from [the Console](https://console.clever-cloud.com) too! As it's in public beta stage, you'll need to activate it through the "Try the new Logs experience" link. You can revert this choice if needed.

This new feature is available for **applications only**.

In this new interface you'll get better access to your instance/deployments, dark/light themes, a text filter, multiple settings (stored into your Clever Cloud account).
