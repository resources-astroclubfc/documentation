If you can deploy on Clever Cloud through our [Console](https://console.clever-cloud.com), our CLI ([Clever Tools](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-tools)), or our [API](/developers/api/), you can also use Terraform and compatible tools such as [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/). We maintain a provider that allows you to manage your resources as code, from applications to add-ons (object storage, databases, etc.).

We've recently added support for Python and [Materia KV](/developers/doc/addons/materia-kv/). It's MongoDB's turn [to be available](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CleverCloud/clevercloud/latest/docs/resources/mongodb). You can now create such an add-on, choose its plan, region and get the credentials to connect to it.
