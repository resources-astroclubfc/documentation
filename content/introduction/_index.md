## History

Initially conceptualized in **Summer of 2024** by then SY students of the Astro Club, the project started out as a simple idea with only one vision. It was meant to be a simple **database** that would contain folders containing official  documents, images and code of official projects undertaken by the students. A simple idea to solve one problem the club faced. To store data in one place so that it can be easily found and time and effort wasted in looking for it can be saved.
<br>

The team of SYs working on this database didn't just stop there though, they evolved the idea to be something more meaningful and useful. They added some more functionality to it by finding new tools and creatively implementing them in the the project so that multiple problems can be solved on the go. Eventually after an year an official department was created in June of 2025 to manage all the operations related to data and insights of the club called **the Resources Team**, inducted in 2025.

The idea was simple, to identify a problem and find or create a solution for the problem.

To solve all the problems the club faced like - loss of crucial knowledge, information and know-hows, inefficiency, lack of transparency and accountability, we use **Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)** or **free versions** of mainstream applications by which we were able to keep the cost of this whole project to **zero**.
